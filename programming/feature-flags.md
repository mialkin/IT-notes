# Feature flags

**Feature flag**, or **feature toggle**, or **release toggle**, or **feature flipper** is a software development concept that allows to enable or disable a feature without modifying the source code or requiring a redeploy.

Feature flags determine at runtime which portions of code are executed. This allows new features to be deployed without making them visible to users or, even more importantly, you can make them visible to only a specific subset of users.

At the most basic level, they take the form of simple conditionals that determine the code path that will be executed.
