# Marshalling

A **marshalling** is the process of transforming the memory representation of an object into a data format suitable for [↑ storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_storage) or [↑ transmission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_communication).

## .NET

In .NET marshalling is the process of transforming types when they need to cross between managed and native code.

Marshalling is needed because the types in the managed and unmanaged code are different.

## RPC

Remote procedure call uses marshalling. When invoking remote functions you will have to marshall the arguments to some kind of standard format so it can be transport across the network.
