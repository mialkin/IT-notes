# Time zones vs offsets

A **time zone** is an area on a map.

An **offset** is the number of hours or minutes a certain time zone is ahead of or behind GMT.

A time zone's offset can change throughout the year because of *daylight saving time* or *summer time*. Sometimes laws change a time zone’s offset or daylight savings pattern.

A **daylight saving time**, a term which is used in the United States, Canada, and Australia, and a **summer time**, a term which is used in Europe and other countries, is the practice of advancing clocks, typically by one hour, during warmer months so that darkness falls at a later clock time.
