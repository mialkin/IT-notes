# Initiatives, epics, stories

An **initiative** is a collection of *epics* that drive toward a common goal.

An **epic** is a large body of work that can be broken down into a number of smaller tasks called *stories*.

A **story**, also called a **user story**, is a short requirement or request written from the perspective of an end user.

## Agile epic vs story

In a sense, stories and epics in agile are similar to stories and epics in film or literature. A story is one simple narrative; a series of related and interdependent stories makes up an epic. The same is true for your work management, where the completion of related stories leads to the completion of an epic. The stories tell the arc of the work completed while the epic shares a high-level view of the unifying objective.

On an agile team, stories are something the team can commit to finish within a one or two week sprint. Oftentimes, developers would work on dozens of stories a month. Epics, in contrast, are few in number and take longer to complete. Teams often have two or three epics they work to complete each quarter.

If your company was launching rockets into space, and wanted to improve the streaming service for your launches, you might structure your stories like the ones below:

- iPhone user needs access to a vertical view of the live feed when using the mobile app
- Desktop user needs a "view full screen" button in the lower right hand corner of the video player

## Agile epic vs initiative

In the same way that epics are made up of stories, initiatives are made up of epics. Initiatives offer another level of organization above epics. In many cases, an initiative compiles epics from multiple teams to achieve a much broader, bigger goal than any of the epics themselves. While an epic is something you might complete in a month or a quarter, initiatives are often completed in multiple quarters to a year.

Example of epics in an initiative:

Let's say your rocket ship company wants to decrease the cost per launch by 5% this year. That's a great fit for an initiative, as no single epic could likely achieve that big of a goal. Within that initiative, there would be epics such as:

- Decrease launch-phase fuel consumption by 1%
- Increase launches per quarter from 3 to 4
- Turn all thermostats down from 71 to 69 degrees
