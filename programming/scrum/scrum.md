**Scrum** is a framework utilizing an *agile* mindset for developing, delivering, and sustaining complex products.

In scrum the development process is broken into small pieces:

1. We do just enough planning to get started with building the minimal feature set.
2. We build what was planned.
3. We test.
4. We review that small feature set and get it ready to ship.

When cycle from above is complete we end up with a *potentially shippable product*. This process usually happens in period of time of 1–3 weeks and repeated time and time again. You end up with several incremented releases called *sprints*. You keep repeating this sprints until your product is feature complete.

> "Potentially shippable" means that the *product owner* can decide if it is ready to ship or there are any additional features needed before it ships.

Sometimes you end up shipping your product after the second sprint, or the third, or the fourth, or even further, but you eventually end up with shipping product.

**Sprint** is a 1 to 3 weeks time box during which happen several incremented releases. The outcome of the sprint is a *potentially shippable product*.

> At the end of the sprint a *sprint review* and *sprint retrospective* meetings occur.

## Roles

There are 3 key roles in scrum that are needed to make framework work well:

- Product owner
- Scrum master
- Team

### Product owner

**Product owner** is a person who is responsible for defining the features that are needed in the product. Product owner has bright ideas that turn into products.

### Scrum master

**Scrum master** is a servant leader of the team responsible for protecting the team and the process, running the meetings and keeping things going.

### Team

**Team** is a group of people that can be made of developers, testers, writers and anyone else that helps in building the product. Team members often play multiple roles: some days developers may end up doing tests or testers may end up writing. Either way the team is working on getting the products done.

## Artifacts

There are 3 artifacts or *documents* that are used in scrum:

- Product backlog
- Sprint backlog
- Burndown chart

### Product backlog

**Product backlog** is a place where product owners create a prioritized list of features known as *user stories* that could go into the product. This list evolves and changes priority with every sprint.

**User stories** are a way of describing a feature set that follows format:

- As a ...
- I need ...
- So that ...

This way of phrasing a user story allows the product owner to specify the right amount of detail for the team to estimate the size of the task.

### Sprint backlog

**Sprint backlog** is a place where the highest priority user stories go. They get estimated for size and are committed to for the next sprint.

### Burndown chart

**Burndown chart** is a chart that shows the progress during the sprint on the completion of tasks in the sprint backlog. This chart should approach zero points as the work is being completed.

## Ceremonies

There are 3 ceremonies that make up scrum. Think of these as meetings or discussions:

- Sprint planning
- Daily scrum
- Sprint review

### Sprint planning

**Sprint planning** is a meeting where the product owner, scrum master and team meet to discuss the top priority user stories, estimate their relative sizes and determine what can go into the next sprint. The output from the sprint planning is the sprint backlog.

### Daily scrum

**Daily scrum** is a brief stand-up meeting where the team discusses what they have completed since the previous meeting, what they are working on and anything that might be blocked or need help.

At the end of the sprint *sprint review* and *retrospective* occur.

### Sprint review

**Sprint review** is a meeting where the team demonstrates the completed work to the product owner.

**Retrospective** is a meeting after sprint review where the team discusses what they can do to improve the process going forward.

## Workflow

Repeat this workflow for each sprint:

## Planning poker

**Planning poker**, also called **Scrum poker**, is a consensus-based, gamified technique for estimating, mostly used for [↑ timeboxing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeboxing) in [↑ Agile principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development#Agile_principles). In planning poker, members of the group make estimates by playing numbered cards face-down to the table, instead of speaking them aloud. The cards are revealed, and the estimates are then discussed. By hiding the figures in this way, the group can avoid the cognitive bias of [↑ anchoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring_effect), where the first number spoken aloud sets a precedent for subsequent estimates.
