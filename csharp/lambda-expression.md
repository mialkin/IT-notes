# Lambda expression, anonymous function

A **lambda expression**, or just **lambda** for short, is an [anonymous function](#anonymous-function) that contains an [expression](/csharp/expression-tree.md#expression) or a sequence of [statements](/csharp/statement.md).

The [â†‘ lambda declaration operator `=>`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/lambda-operator) is used to separate the lambda's parameter list from its body.

An **expression lambda** is a lambda expression that has an [expression](/csharp/expression-tree.md#expression) as its body:

```csharp
(input parameters) => expression
```

A **statement lambda** is a a lambda expression that has a [statement](/csharp/statement.md) block as its body:

```csharp
(input parameters) => { sequence of statements }
```

## Anonymous function

An **anonymous function** is a function that is defined without a name.

Anonymous function is typically used when you need to pass a small piece of logic as an argument to another function, such as in LINQ queries, event handling, or asynchronous programming. Anonymous functions are useful when you don't want to create a separate named method for a simple operation.

The `delegate` operator creates an anonymous function that can be converted to a delegate type:

```csharp
Func<int, int, int> sum = delegate (int a, int b) { return a + b; }
```

Lambda expressions provide a more concise and expressive way to create an anonymous function:

```csharp
Func<int, int, int> sum = (a, b) => a + b;
```

## Usage

Lambda expressions often used to create [delegates](/csharp/types/delegate.md) or [expression tree](/csharp/expression-tree.md) types.

Any lambda expression can be converted to a delegate type:

```csharp
M(x => x * 3);

void M(Whatever whatever)
{
    Console.WriteLine(whatever.Invoke(5));
}

delegate int Whatever(int value);
```

Output:

```output
15
```

Lambda expressions are particularly useful for writing LINQ query expressions.

You can use lambda expressions in any code that requires instances of delegate types or expression trees, for example as an argument to the `Task.Run(Action)` method to pass the code that should be executed in the background.
