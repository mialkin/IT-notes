Statements can perform various actions such as declaring variables, assigning values, controlling the flow of execution, and calling methods.

## Common types of statements

### Declaration statements

Declaration statements declare variables or constants.

```csharp
int x;
const double PI = 3.14;
```

### Assignment statements

Assignment statements assign values to variables.

```csharp
x = 10;
```

### Expression statements

Expression Statements consist of expressions that are evaluated.

```csharp
x = x + 5;
```

### Selection statements

Selection statements control the flow of execution based on conditions. Examples include `if`, `else if`, `else`, and `switch` statements.

```csharp
if (x > 0)
{
    // Do something.
}
else
{
    // Do something else.
}
```

### Iteration statements

Iteration statements execute a block of code repeatedly. Examples include `for`, `foreach`, `while`, and `do-while` statements.

```csharp
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
{
    // Do something repeatedly.
}
```

### Jump statements

Jump statements alter the flow of control by transferring execution to another part of the program. Examples include `break`, `continue`, `return`, and `goto` statements.

```csharp
return x;
```

### Exception handling statements

Exception handling statements handle exceptions that occur during program execution. Examples include `try`, `catch`, `finally`, and `throw` statements.

```csharp
try
{
    // Code that might throw an exception.
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    // Handle the exception.
}
```
