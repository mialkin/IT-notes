# `class`

The `class` is a keyword that is used to declare *classes*.

A **class** is a data structure that may contain data members (constants and fields), function members (methods, properties, events, indexers, operators, instance constructors, finalizers, and static constructors), and nested types.

Class types support inheritance. An **inheritance** is mechanism whereby a derived class can extend and specialize a base class.
