# `class`

The `class` is a keyword that is used to declare *classes*.

Class types support *inheritance* â€” mechanism whereby a derived class can extend and specialize a base class.

A **class** is a data structure that may contain:

1) data members: constants and fields
2) function members: methods, properties, events, indexers, operators, instance constructors, finalizers, and static constructors
3) nested types.
