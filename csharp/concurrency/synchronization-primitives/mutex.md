# `Mutex`

A synchronization primitive that can also be used for interprocess synchronization.

Mutex is a synchronization primitive that grants exclusive access to the shared resource to only one thread. If a thread acquires a mutex, the second thread that wants to acquire that mutex is suspended until the first thread releases the mutex.

The `Mutex` class enforces thread identity, so a mutex can be released only by the thread that acquired it. By contrast, the `Semaphore` class does not enforce thread identity. A mutex can also be passed across application domain boundaries.

The thread that owns a mutex can request the same mutex in repeated calls to `WaitOne` without blocking its execution. However, the thread must call the `ReleaseMutex` method the same number of times to release ownership of the mutex.

Mutexes are of two types: *local mutexes*, which are unnamed, and *named system mutexes*. A local mutex exists only within your process. It can be used by any thread in your process that has a reference to the Mutex object that represents the mutex. Each unnamed Mutex object represents a separate local mutex.

Named system mutexes are visible throughout the operating system, and can be used to synchronize the activities of processes. You can create a `Mutex` object that represents a named system mutex by using a constructor that accepts a name. The operating-system object can be created at the same time, or it can exist before the creation of the `Mutex` object. You can create multiple `Mutex` objects that represent the same named system mutex, and you can use the `OpenExisting` method to open an existing named system mutex.
