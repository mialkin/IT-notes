# Synchronization context

A **synchronization context** is a mechanism that manages the execution context for asynchronous operations. It helps control how asynchronous callbacks are marshaled between threads. The synchronization context ensures that code scheduled to run on a specific context executes within that context, which is important for scenarios involving user interfaces, where updates to the UI must occur on the UI thread.

The `SynchronizationContext` class is a part of the .NET framework and is designed to provide a way to capture and propagate the execution context. It defines methods like `Post` and `Send` that allow you to send delegates for execution on a specific synchronization context.

For example, in UI applications, like those built using WPF or WinForms, there is typically a synchronization context associated with the UI thread. When asynchronous operations complete, and you need to update the UI based on the results, the synchronization context helps ensure that the UI updates are performed on the UI thread. This is crucial because UI elements are not thread-safe, and updating them from a background thread can lead to unpredictable behavior.

In modern C# asynchronous programming, the `async` and `await` keywords handle synchronization context automatically in many cases. However, it's essential to understand synchronization context when dealing with custom or advanced asynchronous scenarios or when working with older asynchronous patterns that don't inherently support the `async/await` model.
