# Thread safety

A **thread safety** is an ability of a piece of code, typically a function, object, or data structure, to be safely accessed and manipulated by multiple threads concurrently without causing unexpected or erroneous behavior.

Thread safety is achieved primarily with locking and by reducing the possibilities for thread interaction.
