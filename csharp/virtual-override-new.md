## `virtual`, `override`

```csharp
var @base = new Base();
var derived = new Derived();
Base baseDerived = new Derived();

@base.Run();
derived.Run();
baseDerived.Run();

public class Base
{
    public virtual void Run()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Base");
    }
}

public class Derived : Base
{
    public override void Run()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Derived");
    }
}

// Output:
// Base
// Derived
// Derived
```

## `new`

```csharp
var @base = new Base();
var derived = new Derived();
Base baseDerived = new Derived();

@base.Run();
derived.Run();
baseDerived.Run();

public class Base
{
    public void Run()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Base");
    }
}

public class Derived : Base
{
    public new void Run()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Derived");
    }
}

// Output:
// Base
// Derived
// Base
```

Code above would work exactly the same way if you remove `new` keyword. The only difference will be that you will get the following compiler warning next to `Run` method of `Derived` class: `The keyword 'new' is required on 'Run' because it hides method 'void Base.Run()'`.

The `new` keyword preserves the relationships but suppresses the warning. By using `new`, you are asserting that you are aware that the member that it modifies hides a member that is inherited from the base class.
