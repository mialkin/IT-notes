# Attribute

An **attribute** is a declarative tag that associates metadata with code: assemblies, types, methods, properties, etc.

After an attribute is associated with a program entity, it can be queried at run time by using a technique called *reflection*.

A declarative tag is depicted by square brackets `[]` placed above or before the element it is used for.
