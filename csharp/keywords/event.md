# `event`

The `event` keyword is used to declare an event in a *publisher* class.

Events enable a class or object to notify other classes or objects when something of interest occurs. The class that sends, or raises, the event is called the *publisher* and the classes that receive (or handle) the event are called *subscribers*.

All events in the .NET class library are based on the `EventHandler` [delegate](delegate.md), which is defined as follows:

```csharp
public delegate void EventHandler(object sender, EventArgs e);
```

Although events in classes that you define can be based on any valid [delegate](delegate.md) type, even delegates that return a value, it is generally recommended that you base your events on the .NET pattern by using `EventHandler`:

The name `EventHandler` can lead to a bit of confusion as it doesn't actually handle the event. The `EventHandler`, and generic `EventHandler<TEventArgs>` are delegate types. A method or lambda expression whose signature matches the delegate definition is the event handler and will be invoked when the event is raised.

## EventArgs Class

Represents the base class for classes that contain event data, and provides a value to use for events that do not include event data.

```csharp
using System;

namespace System
{
    // The base class for all event classes.
    [Serializable]
    [System.Runtime.CompilerServices.TypeForwardedFrom("mscorlib, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089")]
    public class EventArgs
    {
        public static readonly EventArgs Empty = new EventArgs();

        public EventArgs()
        {
        }
    }
}
```

To create a custom event data class, create a class that derives from the `EventArgs` class and provide the properties to store the necessary data. The name of your custom event data class should end with `EventArgs`.

To pass an object that does not contain any data, use the `Empty` field.

## Example

```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        var a = new A();
        a.MyEvent += OnMyEvent;

        a.Act();
    }

    private static void OnMyEvent(object? sender, MyArg arg)
    {
        if (sender != null)
            Console.WriteLine($"Sender: {sender.GetType()}");

        Console.WriteLine($"Number: {arg.Number}");
    }
}

class MyArg : EventArgs
{
    public int Number { get; set; }

    public MyArg(int number)
    {
        Number = number;
    }
}

class A
{
    public event EventHandler<MyArg> MyEvent;

    public void Act()
    {
        MyEvent?.Invoke(this, new MyArg(70));
    }
}
```

Output:

```output
Sender: A
Number: 70
```

## event vs delegate

You can subscribe to `event` and to `delegate`. You can raise `event` and call `delegate`. So why bother with events? You can't call `event` from outside of the class, but you can call `delegate`, if it's public.

You can also overwrite `delegate` with `=` operator, while with `event` you can use only `+=` and `-=`. To remove all subscribers from event you need to set event variable to `null`. A `null` reference is the canonical way of representing an empty invocation list, effectively.

You can write a public method on the class you want the event to fire from and fire the event when it is called. You can then call this method from whatever user of your class. Of course, this ruins encapsulation and is bad design.
