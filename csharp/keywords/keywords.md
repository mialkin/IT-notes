# C# keywords

Keywords are predefined, reserved identifiers that have special meanings to the compiler. They cannot be used as identifiers in your program unless they include `@` as a prefix. For example, `@if` is a valid identifier, but `if` is not because `if` is a keyword.

## Contextual keywords

A contextual keyword is used to provide a specific meaning in the code, but it is not a reserved word in C#. Some contextual keywords, such as `partial` and `where`, have special meanings in two or more contexts.

Contextual keywords have special meaning only in a limited program context and can be used as identifiers outside that context. Generally, as new keywords are added to the C# language, they are added as contextual keywords in order to avoid breaking programs written in earlier versions.
