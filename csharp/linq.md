# LINQ

**Language-integrated query** or **LINQ** provides language-level querying capabilities, and a *higher-order function* API to C# and Visual Basic, that enable you to write expressive declarative code.

A **higher-order function** is a function that takes one or more functions as arguments and/or returns a function as its result.

## PLINQ

**PLINQ**, or **Parallel LINQ**, is a parallel execution engine for LINQ expressions. In other words, a regular LINQ expression can be trivially parallelized across any number of threads.
