## Operator

An **operator** is a symbol that represents a specific operation to be performed on one or more operands.

There are three kinds of operators:

- Unary operators. The unary operators take one operand and use either prefix notation, such as `–x`, or postfix notation, such as `x++`
- Binary operators. The binary operators take two operands and all use infix notation, such as `x + y`
- Ternary operator. Only one ternary operator exists:  `?:`. It takes three operands and uses infix notation: `c ? x : y`

Certain operators can be overloaded.

## Operand

An **operand** is an element of an expression.

Operands can be variables, functions, pointers, and other objects:

- In the expression `2 + 3`, the numbers `2` and `3` are the operands
- In the command `x = 5`, the number `5` and the variable `x` are the operands

Operands along with operators determine the meaning and behavior of an expression.
