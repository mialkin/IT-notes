## CPU cache

A [↑ **CPU cache**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_cache) is a small, high-speed memory component located on or near the CPU.

Its primary purpose is to temporarily store frequently accessed data and instructions, allowing the CPU to retrieve this information more quickly than if it had to access the RAM.

## CPU cache line

A [↑ **CPU cache line**](https://en.algorithmica.org/hpc/cpu-cache/cache-lines/) is a small, contiguous block of memory that represents the smallest unit of data that can be transferred between the cache and the main memory.
