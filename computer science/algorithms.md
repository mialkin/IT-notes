## Binary search

A **binary search** is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array.

## Breadth-first search

A **breadth-first search** (**BFS**) is an algorithm for *traversing* or *searching*  a tree or graph data structures. The algorithm starts at the root node (selecting some arbitrary node as the root node in the case of a graph) and explores all nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level. Extra memory, usually a queue, is needed to keep track of the child nodes that were encountered but not yet explored.

## Depth-first search

A **depth-first search** (**DFS**) is an algorithm for *traversing* or *searching* a tree or graph data structures. The algorithm starts at the root node (selecting some arbitrary node as the root node in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

## Dijkstra's algorithm

**Dijkstra's algorithm** is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks.
