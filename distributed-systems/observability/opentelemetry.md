# OpenTelemetry

[↑ OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io) is a collection of tools, APIs, and SDKs. Use it to instrument, generate, collect, and export telemetry data (metrics, logs, and traces) to help you analyze your software’s performance and behavior.

Telemetry is the feedback you get from your production systems that tells you what’s going on in there—feedback that improves your ability to make decisions about your production systems.
