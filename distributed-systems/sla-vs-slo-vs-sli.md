# SLA vs SLO vs SLI

## SLA

A **service level agreement** or **SLA** is an agreement between provider and client about measurable metrics like uptime, responsiveness, and responsibilities.

These agreements are typically drawn up by a company's new business and legal teams and they represent the promises you're making to customers and the consequences if you fail to live up to those promises. Typically, consequences include financial penalties, service credits, or license extensions.

## SLO

A **service level objective** or **SLO** is an agreement within an SLA about a specific metric like uptime or response time.

If the SLA is the formal agreement between you and your customer, SLOs are the individual promises you're making to that customer.

## SLI

A **service level indicator** or SLI measures compliance with an SLO.

If your SLA specifies that your systems will be available 99.95% of the time, your SLO is likely 99.95% uptime and your SLI is the actual measurement of your uptime. Maybe it's 99.96%. Maybe 99.99%. To stay in compliance with your SLA, the SLI will need to meet or exceed the promises made in that document.
