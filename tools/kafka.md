**Kafka** is a horizontally scalable, fault tolerant, and fast messaging system. It’s a pub-sub model in which various producers and consumers can write and read. It decouples source and target systems. Some of the key features are:

- Scale to hundreds of nodes
- Handle millions of messages per second
- Real-time processing (~10ms)
