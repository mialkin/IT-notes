## Best practices for writing Dockerfiles

A Docker image consists of read-only layers each of which represents a Dockerfile instruction. The layers are stacked and each one is a delta of the changes from the previous layer. Consider this Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:18.04
COPY . /app
RUN make /app
CMD python /app/app.py
```

Each instruction above creates one layer. When you run an image and generate a container, you add a new writable layer (the “container layer”) on top of the underlying layers. All changes made to the running container, such as writing new files, modifying existing files, and deleting files, are written to this thin writable container layer.

### Understand build context

When you issue a `docker build` command, the current working directory is called the *build context*. By default, the Dockerfile is assumed to be located here, but you can specify a different location with the file flag `-f`. Regardless of where the Dockerfile actually lives, all recursive contents of files and directories in the current directory are sent to the Docker daemon as the build context.

### Enable BuildKit

```bash
DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0 docker build .
```

```yml
FROM alpine

WORKDIR /app
RUN echo "hello world"
RUN ls -l
```

### Exclude with .dockerignore

To exclude files not relevant to the build (without restructuring your source repository) use a *.dockerignore* file. This file supports exclusion patterns similar to *.gitignore* files.

### Use multi-stage builds

[Multi-stage builds](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/) allow you to drastically reduce the size of your final image, without struggling to reduce the number of intermediate layers and files.

Because an image is built during the final stage of the build process, you can minimize image layers by *leveraging build cache*.

### Leverage build cache

When building an image, Docker steps through the instructions in your Dockerfile, executing each in the order specified. As each instruction is examined, Docker looks for an existing image in its cache that it can reuse, rather than creating a new (duplicate) image.

If you do not want to use the cache at all, you can use the `--no-cache=true` option on the `docker build` command. However, if you do let Docker use its cache, it is important to understand when it can, and cannot, find a matching image. The basic rules that Docker follows are outlined below:

- Starting with a parent image that is already in the cache, the next instruction is compared against all child images derived from that base image to see if one of them was built using the exact same instruction. If not, the cache is invalidated.

- In most cases, simply comparing the instruction in the Dockerfile with one of the child images is sufficient. However, certain instructions require more examination and explanation.

- For the `ADD` and `COPY` instructions, the contents of the file(s) in the image are examined and a checksum is calculated for each file. The last-modified and last-accessed times of the file(s) are not considered in these checksums. During the cache lookup, the checksum is compared against the checksum in the existing images. If anything has changed in the file(s), such as the contents and metadata, then the cache is invalidated.

- Aside from the `ADD` and `COPY` commands, cache checking does not look at the files in the container to determine a cache match. For example, when processing a `RUN apt-get -y update` command the files updated in the container are not examined to determine if a cache hit exists. In that case just the command string itself is used to find a match.

Once the cache is invalidated, all subsequent Dockerfile commands generate new images and the cache is not used.

### Minimize the number of layers

In older versions of Docker, it was important that you minimized the number of layers in your images to ensure they were performant. The following features were added to reduce this limitation:

- Only the instructions `RUN`, `COPY`, `ADD` create layers. Other instructions create temporary intermediate images, and do not increase the size of the build.

- Where possible, use [multi-stage builds](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/), and only copy the artifacts you need into the final image. This allows you to include tools and debug information in your intermediate build stages without increasing the size of the final image.

### Sort multi-line arguments

Whenever possible, ease later changes by sorting multi-line arguments alphanumerically. This helps to avoid duplication of packages and make the list much easier to update. This also makes PRs a lot easier to read and review. Adding a space before a backslash `\` helps as well:

```dockerfile
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
  bzr \
  cvs \
  git \
  mercurial \
  subversion \
  && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```
