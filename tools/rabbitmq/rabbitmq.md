## Exchanges

**Exchanges** are AMQP 0-9-1 entities where messages are sent. Exchanges take a message and route it into zero or more queues. The routing algorithm used depends on the **exchange type** and rules called **bindings**.

## Exchange types

AMQP 0-9-1 brokers provide four exchange types: direct, fanout, topic, headers.

### Direct exchange

A direct exchange delivers messages to queues based on the message routing key. Here is how it works:

- A queue binds to the exchange with a routing key `K`
- When a new message with routing key R arrives at the direct exchange, the exchange routes it to the queue if `K` = `R`

### Fanout exchange

A fanout exchange routes messages to all of the queues that are bound to it and the routing key is ignored. If `N` queues are bound to a fanout exchange, when a new message is published to that exchange a copy of the message is delivered to all `N` queues.

### Topic exchange

Topic exchanges route messages to one or many queues based on matching between a message routing key and the pattern that was used to bind a queue to an exchange. The topic exchange type is often used to implement various publish/subscribe pattern variations. Topic exchanges are commonly used for the multicast routing of messages.

Topic exchanges have a very broad set of use cases. Whenever a problem involves multiple consumers/applications that selectively choose which type of messages they want to receive, the use of topic exchanges should be considered.

### Headers exchange

A headers exchange is designed for routing on multiple attributes that are more easily expressed as message headers than a routing key. Headers exchanges ignore the routing key attribute. Instead, the attributes used for routing are taken from the headers attribute. A message is considered matching if the value of the header equals the value specified upon binding.

It is possible to bind a queue to a headers exchange using more than one header for matching. In this case, the broker needs one more piece of information from the application developer, namely, should it consider messages with any of the headers matching, or all of them? This is what the `x-match` binding argument is for. When the `x-match` argument is set to "any", just one matching header value is sufficient. Alternatively, setting `x-match` to "all" mandates that all the values must match.

Headers exchanges can be looked upon as "direct exchanges on steroids". Because they route based on header values, they can be used as direct exchanges where the routing key does not have to be a string; it could be an integer or a hash (dictionary) for example.

Note that headers beginning with the string `x-` will not be used to evaluate matches.

## Virtual hosts

To make it possible for a single broker to host multiple isolated "environments" (groups of users, exchanges, queues and so on), AMQP 0-9-1 includes the concept of **virtual hosts** (**vhosts**). They provide completely isolated environments in which AMQP entities live. Protocol clients specify what vhosts they want to use during connection negotiation.

## Statuses

| Delivery (auto ack) | Number of messages prefeteched by consumer with `autoack` set to `true` they are acked automatically, even if they were not proccessed yet: `channel.BasicConsume(queue, autoAck: true, consumer)` |
| Consumer ack        | Number of messages acked by consumer when `autoack` is set to `false`                                                                                                                              |
| Redelivered         | Number of unacked messages that were resend to consumers                                                                                                                                           |

Imagine Consumer 1 prefteched 9 messages from a queue and haven't acknowledged them. No new messages arrive to the queue, so Consumer 1 stays still. Now Consumer 2 starts consuming from the queue and stays still, because no new messages arrive to the queue. If we kill Consumer 1, then Consumer 2 will start receiving (redelivery) those 9 messages from Rabbit, that were not acked by Consumer 1.

## Prefetch count

There are two prefetch options available, _channel prefetch count_ and _consumer prefetch count_.

The `basic_qos` function contains the global flag. Setting the value to `false` applies the count to each new consumer. Setting the value to `true` applies a channel prefetch count to all consumers. Most APIs set the global flag to `false` by default.

A larger prefetch count generally improves the rate of message delivery. The broker does not need to wait for acknowledgments as often and the communication between the broker and consumers decreases. Still, smaller prefetch values can be ideal for distributing messages across larger systems. Smaller values maintain the evenness of message consumption. A value of one helps ensure equal message distribution.

### How to set the correct prefetch value?

If you have one single or only a few consumers processing messages quickly, we recommend prefetching many messages at once to keep your client as busy as possible. If you have about the same processing time all the time and network behavior remains the same, simply take the total round trip time and divide by the processing time on the client for each message to get an estimated prefetch value.

In a situation with many consumers and short processing time, we recommend a lower prefetch value. A value that is too low will keep the consumers idling a lot since they need to wait for messages to arrive. A value that is too high may keep one consumer busy while other consumers are being kept in an idling state.

If you have many consumers and/or long processing time, we recommend setting the prefetch count to one (1) so that messages are evenly distributed among all your workers.

Please note that if your client auto-acks messages, the prefetch value will have no effect.

Avoid the usual mistake of having an unlimited prefetch, where one client receives all messages and runs out of memory and crashes, causing all the messages to be re-delivered.

## Channels

Some applications need multiple connections to the broker. However, it is undesirable to keep many TCP connections open at the same time because doing so consumes system resources and makes it more difficult to configure firewalls. AMQP 0-9-1 connections are multiplexed with **channels** that can be thought of as "lightweight connections that share a single TCP connection".

Every protocol operation performed by a client happens on a channel. Communication on a particular channel is completely separate from communication on another channel, therefore every protocol method also carries a channel ID (a.k.a. channel number), an integer that both the broker and clients use to figure out which channel the method is for.

A channel only exists in the context of a connection and never on its own. When a connection is closed, so are all channels on it.

For applications that use multiple threads/processes for processing, it is very common to open a new channel per thread/process and not share channels between them.

## Connections

AMQP 0-9-1 connections are typically long-lived. AMQP 0-9-1 is an application level protocol that uses TCP for reliable delivery. Connections use authentication and can be protected using TLS. When an application no longer needs to be connected to the server, it should gracefully close its AMQP 0-9-1 connection instead of abruptly closing the underlying TCP connection.

## AMQP 0-9-1 methods

AMQP 0-9-1 is structured as a number of **methods**. Methods are operations (like HTTP methods) and have nothing in common with methods in object-oriented programming languages. Protocol methods in AMQP 0-9-1 are grouped into _classes_. Classes are just logical groupings of AMQP methods.

Let us take a look at the `exchange` class, a group of methods related to operations on exchanges. It includes the following operations: `exchange.declare`, `exchange.declare-ok`,
`exchange.delete`, `exchange.delete-ok`.

Not all AMQP 0-9-1 methods have counterparts. Some (`basic.publish` being the most widely used one) do not have corresponding "response" methods and some others (`basic.get`, for example) have more than one possible "response".

## Rejecting Messages

When a consumer application receives a message, processing of that message may or may not succeed. An application can indicate to the broker that message processing has failed (or cannot be accomplished at the time) by rejecting a message. When rejecting a message, an application can ask the broker to discard or requeue it. When there is only one consumer on a queue, make sure you do not create infinite message delivery loops by rejecting and requeueing a message from the same consumer over and over again.
