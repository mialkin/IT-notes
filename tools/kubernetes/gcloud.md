## Container registry

Before you can push or pull images, you must configure Docker to use the gcloud command-line tool to authenticate requests to Container Registry:

Change current project:

```bash
gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID
# gcloud auth login
gcloud auth configure-docker
```

Obtain image and push it:

```bash
docker pull busybox
docker tag busybox gcr.io/PROJECT_ID/busybox
docker push gcr.io/PROJECT_ID/busybox
```
