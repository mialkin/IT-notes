# PromQL

**PromQL**, stands for [↑ Prometheus query language](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics), is a functional query language that lets the user select and aggregate time series data in real time. It allows for a wide range of operations including aggregation, slicing and dicing, prediction and joins.

The result of a PromQL expression can either be shown as a graph, viewed as tabular data in Prometheus's [↑ expression browser](http://localhost:9090/graph), or consumed by external systems via the [↑ HTTP API](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/api).
