# mTLS

**Mutual TLS** or **mTLS** is a method for mutual authentication. mTLS ensures that the parties at each end of a network connection are who they claim to be by verifying that they both have the correct private key. The information within their respective TLS certificates provides additional verification.

mTLS is often used in a *Zero Trust security* framework* to verify users, devices, and servers within an organization. It can also help keep APIs secure.
