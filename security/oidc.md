# OpenID Connect

**OpenID Connect** (**OIDC**) is a authentication protocol built on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol, which allows clients to verify the identity of an user based on the authentication performed by an authorization server, as well as to obtain basic profile information about the user in an interoperable and REST-like manner.
