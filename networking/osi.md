# OSI model

**Open Systems Interconnection model** or **OSI model** is a conceptual model from the International Organization for Standardization, ISO, that "provides a common basis for the coordination of standards development for the purpose of systems interconnection".

In the OSI reference model, the communications between a computing system are split into seven different abstraction layers: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application.
