# REST

**REST** is an IPC mechanism that almost always uses HTTP.

A key concept in REST is a *resource*, which typically represents a business object such as a Customer or Product, or a collection of business objects.

REST uses the HTTP verbs for manipulating resources, which are referenced using a URL. For example, a GET request returns the representation of a resource, which might be in the form of an XML document or JSON object. A POST request creates a new resource and a PUT request updates a resource.
