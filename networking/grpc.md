# gRPC

gRPC is an open source high performance RPC framework.

gRPC uses HTTP/2 for transport, Protocol Buffers as the interface description language, and provides features such as authentication, bidirectional streaming and flow control, blocking or nonblocking bindings, and cancellation and timeouts. It generates cross-platform client and server bindings for many languages.

Most common usage scenarios include connecting services in microservices style architecture and connect mobile devices, browser clients to backend services.

**Protocol Buffers** (**Protobuf**) is a method of serializing structured data. It is useful in developing programs to communicate with each other over a wire or for storing data. The method involves an interface description language that describes the structure of some data and a program that generates source code from that description for generating or parsing a stream of bytes that represents the structured data.
