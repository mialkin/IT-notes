# PowerShell

Windows has two command shells: the **Command shell** and **PowerShell**. Each shell is a software program that provides direct communication between you and the operating system or application, providing an environment to automate IT operations.

**Command Prompt** is one of the command-line interface programs used to execute commands in Windows operating systems.

PowerShell was designed to extend the capabilities of the Command shell to run PowerShell commands called _cmdlets_. Cmdlets are similar to Windows Commands but provide a more extensible scripting language. You can run Windows Commands and PowerShell cmdlets in Powershell, but the Command shell can only run Windows Commands and not PowerShell cmdlets.

> For the most robust, up-to-date Windows automation, we recommend using PowerShell instead of Windows Commands.

## What is PowerShell?

PowerShell is a cross-platform task automation and configuration management framework, consisting of a command-line shell and scripting language. Unlike most shells, which accept and return text, PowerShell is built on top of the .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR), and accepts and returns .NET objects. This fundamental change brings entirely new tools and methods for automation.

## What is Windows Terminal?

**Windows Terminal** is a modern terminal application for users of command-line tools and shells like Command Prompt, PowerShell, and Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).
