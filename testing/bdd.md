# Behavior-driven development (BDD)

**Behavior-driven development** is an agile software development process that combines the general techniques and principles of TDD with ideas from domain-driven design and object-oriented analysis and design to provide software development and management teams with shared tools and a shared process to collaborate on software development.

## Tools

[↑ Cucumber](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-ruby) is a software tool that supports behavior-driven development. Central to the Cucumber BDD approach is its ordinary language parser called *Gherkin*. It allows expected software behaviors to be specified in a logical language that customers can understand. It is often used for testing other software. It runs automated *acceptance tests* written in a BDD style.

[↑ Specflow](https://specflow.org) is a free and open source BDD framework that provides test automation for .NET, based on the Gherkin specification language.

[↑ Xunit.Gherkin.Quick](https://github.com/ttutisani/Xunit.Gherkin.Quick) is a lightweight BDD test framework that targets .NET Standard. It parses Gherkin language and executes Xunit tests corresponding to scenarios.
