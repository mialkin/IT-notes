## Canvas

The [↑ canvas](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041064814-Explore-the-canvas) in Figma is the backdrop on which all of your frames, groups, and other layers live.

## Frame

A [↑ frame](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041539473-Frames-in-Figma) is a foundational element for your designs that can act as a top-level container, like a device viewport, and/or represent areas or components within your design.

Frames allow you to choose an area of the canvas to create your designs in.

You can nest frames within other frames.

### Layout grid

A [↑ layout grid](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040450513-Create-layout-grids-with-grids-columns-and-rows) is a thing that helps to align objects within a frame.
