# TypeScript

[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) is a free and open-source high-level programming language developed by Microsoft that adds static typing with optional type annotations to JavaScript.

TypeScript is designed for the development of large applications and transpiles to JavaScript.

A **transpiler** is a type of translator that takes the source code of a program written in a programming language as its input and produces an equivalent source code in the same or a different programming language.
