# T-SQL

**Transact-SQL** or **T-SQL** is Microsoft's and Sybase's proprietary extension to the SQL used to interact with relational databases.

T-SQL expands on the SQL standard to include procedural programming, local variables, various support functions for string processing, date processing, mathematics, etc.
