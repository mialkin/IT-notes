# Choreography vs orchestration

*Choreography* and *orchestration* are two different approaches for how to interact with other software components in a microservice architecture. Both have their benefits and drawbacks.

## Choreography

**Choreography** is a design pattern that enables the development of distributed systems where the components interact with each other through a set of well-defined interfaces, without requiring a central authority or coordinator.

A choreographed system, by definition, uses event-driven communication, whereas microservice orchestration uses command-driven communication. An event is something which happened in the past and is a fact. The sender does not know who picks up the event or what happens next.

## Orchestration

**Orchestration** is a design pattern that enables the development of distributed systems where a central authority or coordinator is responsible for managing and coordinating the actions of the different components.

An orchestrated system uses command driven communication. In comparison to the event a command has an intent. The sender wants something to happen and the recipient does not necessarily know who issued the command.
