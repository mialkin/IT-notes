# Proxy

The **Proxy** is a creational software design pattern that provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

## Applicability

Proxy is applicable whenever there is a need for a more versatile or sophisticated
reference to an object than a simple pointer. Here are several common situations
in which the Proxy pattern is applicable:

1. A **remote proxy** provides a local representative for an object in a different
address space.

2. A **virtual proxy** creates expensive objects on demand.

3. A **protection proxy** controls access to the original object. Protection
proxies are useful when objects should have different access rights.

4. A **smart reference** is a replacement for a bare pointer that performs
additional actions when an object is accessed. Typical uses include
   * counting the number of references to the real object so that it can
be freed automatically when there are no more references (also called
smart pointers).
   * loading a persistent object into memory when it's first referenced.
   * checking that the real object is locked before it's accessed to ensure
that no other object can change it.

## Participants

* **Proxy**
  * maintains a reference that lets the proxy access the real subject. Proxy may refer to a Subject if the RealSubject and Subject interfaces are the same.
  * provides an interface identical to Subject's so that a proxy can by substituted for the real subject.
  * controls access to the real subject and may be responsible for creating and deleting it.
  * other responsibilities depend on the kind of proxy:
    * *remote proxies* are responsible for encoding a request and its arguments and for sending the encoded request to the real subject in a different address space.
    * *virtual proxies* may cache additional information about the real subject so that they can postpone accessing it. For example, the ImageProxy from the Motivation caches the real image's extent.
    * *protection proxies* check that the caller has the access permissions required to perform a request.
* **Subject**
  * defines the common interface for RealSubject and Proxy so that a Proxy can be used anywhere a RealSubject is expected.
* **RealSubject**
  * defines the real object that the proxy represents.

## C# implementation

```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        IImage image = new ProxyImage("forest.png");
        image.Display();
    }
}

interface IImage
{
    void Display();
}

class RealImage : IImage
{
    private readonly string _filename;

    public RealImage(string filename)
    {
        _filename = filename;
        LoadImageFromDisk();
    }

    private void LoadImageFromDisk()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Loading {_filename}");
    }

    public void Display()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Displaying {_filename}");
    }
}

class ProxyImage : IImage
{
    private readonly string _filename;
    private RealImage _realImage;

    public ProxyImage(string filename)
    {
        _filename = filename;
    }

    public void Display()
    {
        if(_realImage == null)
            _realImage = new RealImage(_filename);

        _realImage.Display();
    }
}
```

```output
Loading forest.png
Displaying forest.png
```

## Related Patterns

[Adapter](adapter.md): An adapter provides a different interface to the object it adapts.

In contrast, a proxy provides the same interface as its subject. However, a proxy used for access protection might refuse to perform an operation that the subject will perform, so its interface may be effectively a subset of the subject's.

[Decorator](decorator.md): Although decorators can have similar implementations as proxies, decorators have a different purpose. A decorator adds one or more responsibilities to an object, whereas a proxy controls access to an object.

Proxies vary in the degree to which they are implemented like a decorator. A protection proxy might be implemented exactly like a decorator. On the other hand, a remote proxy will not contain a direct reference to its real subject but only an indirect reference, such as "host ID and local address on host." A virtual proxy will start off with an indirect reference such as a file name but will
eventually obtain and use a direct reference.
