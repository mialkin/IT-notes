# Specification

**Specification** is a pattern that allows us to encapsulate some piece of domain knowledge into a single unit — specification — and reuse it in different parts of the code base.

Specification aims at two goals:

1\. Avoid domain knowledge duplication. Stick to DRY principle

2\. Enable declarative approach. Improve code maintainability
