# Domain-Driven Design

The term **domain-driven design** was coined by Eric Evans in his 2004 book.

DDD provides clean representation of the problem in the code that can be readily understood and verified via tests.

With DDD you "divide and conquer" â€” by separating a problem into separate subdomains each problem can be tackled intependently.

> "While domain-driven design provides many technical benefits, such as maintainability, it should be applied only to complex domains where the model and the linguistic processes provide clear benefits in the communication of complex information, and in the formulation of a common understanding of the domain." Eric Evans, Domain-Driven design

Some scenarios in which DDD is going to be an overkill:

- application which doesn't need much more than lots of CRUD logic
- application with simple domain but lots of technical challanges
