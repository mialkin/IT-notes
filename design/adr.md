# Architecture decision record

An **architecture decision record** or **ADR** is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences.

An **architecture decision** or **AD** is a software design choice that addresses a significant requirement.

An **architecture decision log** or **ADL** is the collection of all ADRs created and maintained for a particular project or organization.

An **architecturally-significant requirement** or **ASR** is a requirement that has a measurable effect on a software system’s architecture.

All these are within the topic of **architecture knowledge management** or **AKM**.
