# Technical debt

A **technical debt** is the set of problems in a development effort that make forward progress on customer value inefficient.

Technical debt saps productivity by making code hard to understand, fragile, difficult to validate, and creates unplanned work that blocks progress. Technical debt is insidious. It starts small and grows over time through rushed changes, lack of context and lack of discipline.

Organizations often find that more than 50% of their capacity is sapped by technical debt.
