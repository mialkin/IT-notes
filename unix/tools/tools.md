```bash
cat /etc/*-release
```

## apt

The **apt** provides a high-level commandline interface for the package management system. It is intended as an end user interface and enables some options better suited for interactive usage by default compared to more specialized APT tools like `apt-get` and `apt-cache`.

| Command                  | Description                                                                 |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| apt install PACKAGE_NAME | Install specific package if it doesn't exist or upgrade it if it does exist |
| apt list --upgradeable   | List available updates but do not install them                              |
| apt search PACKAGE_NAME  | Search for a package                                                        |
| apt update               | Update list of available packages                                           |
| apt upgrade              | Update all installed packages                                               |

## chmod

**chmod** is the command and system call which is used to change the access permissions of file system objects (files and directories). The name is an abbreviation of _change mode_.

**Modes** are the filesystem permissions given to _user_ (i.e. the file owner), _group_ (i.e. the group owning the file) and _others_ (users who are not the owner of the file and who are not members of the group) classes to access files under Unix.

References:

- u — user, file owner
- g — group, members of the file's group
- o — others, users who are neither the file's owner nor memebers of the file's group
- a — all, all three of the above, same as `ugo`

Operators:

- \+ — adds the specified modes to the specified classes
- \- — removes the specified modes from the specified classes
- = — the modes specified are to be made the exact modes for the specified classes

Modes:

- r — read, read a file or list a directory's contents
- w — write, write to a file or directory
- x — execute, execute a file or recurse a directory tree

| Command               | Description                        |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| chmod +x FILE_NAME    | Add execute mode to all classes    |
| chmod a-rwx FILE_NAME | Removes all modes from all classes |
| chmod 100 FILE_NAME   | Adds _only_ execute mode to user   |
| chmod 200 FILE_NAME   | Adds _only_ write mode to user     |
| chmod 400 FILE_NAME   | Adds _only_ read mode to user      |

## chown

| Command                        | Description                    |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| chown -R USER_NAME FOLDER_NAME | Change the owner of the folder |

### Download a file

Get a web page and store in a local file with a specific name:

```bash
curl -o thatpage.html http://www.example.com
```

Get a web page and store in a local file, make the local file get the name of the remote document (if no file name part is specified in the URL, this will fail):

```bash
curl -O http://www.example.com/index.html
```

### POST (HTTP)

Post a simple "name" and "phone" guestbook (the post data must be urlencoded):

```bash
curl -d "name=Rafael%20Sagula&phone=3320780" http://www.where.com/guest.cgi
```

## dd

Copies the standard input to the standard output.

Input data is read and written in 512-byte blocks. If input reads are short, input from multiple reads are aggregated to form the output block. When finished, `dd` displays the number of complete and partial input and output blocks and truncated input records to the standard error output.

Generate a file exactly 24MB in size:

```bash
dd if=/dev/zero of=output.dat bs=1m count=24
```

## df

Display free disk space.

| Command | Description                                                                |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| du -h . | Dispaly disk usage statistics in human-readable form for current directory |

## find

Find is a command-line utility that locates files based on some user-specified criteria and then applies some requested action on each matched object.

| Command                                     | Description                                                                 |

| find . -name "\*.txt" -type f               | Find inside current directory all files with the extension `.txt`           |
| find . -name "a" -type d -exec rm -rf {} \; | Remove folder with name `a`                                                 |

## grep

**grep** is a command-line utility for searching plain-text data sets for lines that match a regular expression. Its name comes from the `ed` command g/re/p (**g**lobally search for a **r**egular **e**xpression and **p**rint matching lines), which has the same effect.

## htop

| Command          | Description                     |

| <kbd>\\</kbd>    | filter                          |
| <kbd>/</kbd>     | search                          |
| <kbd>Space</kbd> | select/deselect a single record |
| <kbd>u</kbd>     | filter processes by user        |
| <kbd>k</kbd>     | send command to process         |
| <kbd>U</kbd>     | deselect all records            |

## iproute2

**iproute2** is a collection of utilities for controlling and monitoring various aspects of networking in the Linux kernel, including routing, network interfaces, tunnels, traffic control, and network-related device drivers.

iproute2 collection contains the following command-line utilities: **ip**, **ss**, **bridge**, **rtacct**, **rtmon**, **tc**, **ctstat**, **lnstat**, **nstat**, **routef**, **routel**, **rtstat**, **tipc**, **arpd** and **devlink**.

## less

The **less** is a program similar to `more`, but it has many more features. Less does not have to read the entire input file before starting, so with large input files it starts up faster than text editors like `vi`. Commands are based on both `more` and `vi`.

```sh
sudo less /var/log/syslog
```

## rg

The **rg** tool allows to search current directory recursively for lines matching a pattern.

Search "ssh" keyword.

```sh
rg text_in_file
rg -l filename_text
```

## rsync

The **rsync** is a fast and extraordinarily versatile file copying tool. It can copy locally, to/from another host over any remote shell, or to/from a remote rsync daemon. It is famous for its delta-transfer algorithm, which reduces the amount of data sent over the network by sending only the differences between the source files and the existing files in the destination.

Rsync is widely used for backups and mirroring and as an improved copy command for everyday use.

Rsync finds files that need to be transferred using a "quick check" algorithm (by default) that looks for files that have changed in size or in last-modified time.

| Command                                     | Description                                                                                                                                                             |

| rsync Original/\* Backup/                   | Copies all files inside Original directory to Backup directory                                                                                                          |
| rsync -r Original/ Backup/                  | Copies recursively all files and folders inside Original directory to Backup directory                                                                                  |
| rsync -r Original Backup/                   | Copies entire Original directory recursively, not just its content                                                                                                      |
| rsync -av Original/ Backup/                 | The same as previous. `v` stands for verbose. `a` stands for "archive"; it copies everything recursively preserving information about file permissions and other things |
| rsync -av --dry-run Original/ Backup/       | Displays what files would have copied without actually doing anything                                                                                                   |
| rsync -zaP Original user@host.com:/where/to | Transfers entire Original directory to remote (write Original/ to transfer only folder's content instead) `z` stands for compress, `P` means show progress              |

Example:

```bash
rsync -v user@domain.ru:/var/file.db /Users/aleksei/Backups/file-`date +'%Y-%m-%d'`.db
```

## scp

Secure copy (remote file copy program); scp copies files between hosts on a network. It uses ssh for data transfer, and uses the same authentication and provides the same security as ssh. scp will ask for passwords or passphrases if they are needed for authentication.

local → remote:

```sh
scp /file/to/send username@remote:/where/to/put
```

remote → local:

Copy from remote to local:

```sh
scp username@remote:/file/to/send /where/to/put
```

## sed

**sed**, short for _stream editor_, is a Unix utility that parses and transforms text, using a simple, compact programming language.

Perhaps the most well-known use for sed is substituting text. sed can search for text patterns using regular expressions, and then replace the found text with something else:

```bash
's/old_word/new_word/g'
```

The `s` is the substitute command, `g` substitutes each occurrence in the line, not only the first one.

Regex replace:

```bash
sed -E 's/($.+$)/\1/' calculus/chapter\ 1.md
```

## systemctl

The **systemctl** is a controlling interface and inspection tool for service manager systemd.

The **systemd** is the mother of all processes, responsible for bringing the Linux host up to a state where productive work can be done.

| Command               | Meaning           |
| --------------------- | ----------------- |
| sudo systemctl reboot | Reboot the system |

## tail

The **tail** command outputs the last part of files.

By default tail prints the last 10 lines of each specified file to standard output.

| Command                    | Description                                   |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| tail -f /var/log/syslog    | `-f` — output appended data as the file grows |
| tail -n 20 /var/log/syslog | `-n` — output the last n lines                |

## tar

GNU **tar** is an archiving program designed to store multiple files in a single file (an **archive**), and to manipulate such archives. The archive can be either a regular file or a device (e.g. a tape drive, hence the name of the program, which stands for **t**ape **ar**chiver), which can be located either on the local or on a remote machine.

| Command                                 | Explanation                                                                   |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| tar cf archive.tar                      | Create uncompressed archive file `archive.tar`                                |
| tar czf archive.tar.gz directory1 file1 | Create compressed archive file `archive.tar.gz` from `directory1` and `file1` |
| tar xf archive.tar.gz                   | Extract `archive.tar.gz` archive file to current folder                       |
| tar xf archive.tar.gz -C /path/to/dir   | Extract `archive.tar.gz` archive to specific folder                           |
| tar tf archive.tar                      | List contents of `archive.tar` archive file to stdout                         |

**Options**:

- `c` — create new archive
- `f` — use archive file (`archive.tar.gz`)
- `t` — list archive contents to stdout
- `v` — verbose output
- `x` — extract to disk from the archive
- `z` — filter the archive through gzip
- `-C` — changes the directory
- `--exclude <pattern>` — do not process files or directories that match the specified pattern

## telnet

Installation:

```bash
apt-get install telnet
```

Usage:

Test if port 22 is open on `your.hostname.com`:

```bash
telnet your.hostname.com 22
```

Success message looks like:

```text
Trying 10.11.12.13...
Connected to your.hostname.com.
Escape character is '^]'.
SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_8.9p1 Ubuntu-3
```

Failure message looks like:

```text
Trying 10.11.12.13...
telnet: connect to address 10.11.12.13: Connection refused
telnet: Unable to connect to remote host
```

## xargs

**xargs** is a command on Unix and most Unix-like operating systems used to build and execute commands from standard input. It converts input from standard input into arguments to a command. Some commands such as grep and awk can take input either as command-line arguments or from the standard input.

General syntax:

```text
[list_generating_command] | xargs [xargs_options] [command]
```

Delete files:

```bash
$ ls
one.sh one.py two.sh two.py

$ find . -name "*.sh"| xargs rm -rf

$ ls
one.py two.py
```

Compress files:

```bash
$ ls | xargs -p -l gzip
```

## xxd

Creates a hex dump of a given file or standard input. It can also convert a hex dump back to its original binary form.

```bash
xxd filename | less
```
