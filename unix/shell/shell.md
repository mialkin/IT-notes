# Shell

In computing, a **shell** is a user interface for access to an operating system's services. In general, operating system shells use either a command-line interface, CLI or graphical user interface, GUI, depending on a computer's role and particular operation. It is named a shell because it is the outermost layer around the operating system.

Command-line shells require the user to be familiar with commands and their calling syntax, and to understand concepts about the shell-specific scripting language, for example, bash.

## Bash

**Bash**, GNU Bourne-Again Shell, is an sh-compatible command language interpreter that executes commands read from the standard input or from a file. Bash also incorporates useful features from the Korn and C shells, ksh and csh.
